What changed, why:
- Added `data/prewritten-polls.json`, `lib/prewrittenPolls.ts`, and an admin presets API route to load and validate prewritten polls.
- Updated the admin UI with a presets sidebar that populates the poll form and disables presets while a poll is active.
- Added Jest coverage for preset parsing and documented the JSON format in `README.md`.
- Updated execplan progress/outcomes and CURRENT state to reflect completion.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run test:agg` passed.
