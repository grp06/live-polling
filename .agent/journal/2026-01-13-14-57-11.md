# Journal Entry (2026-01-13 14:57:11)

What changed, why:
- Stopped polling on the attendee and admin pages, leaving results polling only on the projector results screen. Removed attendee/admin live results/history UI so only /results shows live updates.

What was observed:
- KV read usage was too high due to frequent polling on multiple clients.

Links to commits:
- None.
