# Journal 2026-01-13-01-59-58

What changed, why:
- Added poll type support (slider vs multiple choice) across poll types, service logic, API payloads, and UI rendering.
- Updated aggregation logic to handle multiple-choice counts and slider averages, plus history summaries.
- Added Jest unit tests for multiple-choice aggregation and vote validation, expanded the aggregation script, and added a Playwright UI test with mocked API routes.
- Updated README and execplan to document new flows and tests.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run test:agg` passed after restoring default import interop.
- `npm run test:e2e` not run (Playwright browsers not installed).
