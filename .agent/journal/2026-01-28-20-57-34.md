# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 20:57:34)

What changed, why:
- Added failing Jest tests for the planned admin-route helper in `app/api/admin/__tests__/adminRoute.test.ts` to drive the refactor.

What was observed:
- `npm test` fails because `@/app/api/admin/adminRoute` does not exist yet (expected at this stage).

Links to commits:
- None.
