What changed, why:
- Updated .agent/execplans/execplan.md to scope the new requirement: slider vs multiple-choice polls, new UI flows, and updated acceptance criteria.
- Updated .agent/CURRENT.md with next actions and constraints for the new work.

What was observed:
- Existing poll model and UI are slider-only; plan needed to expand types and results handling.

Links to commits:
- None yet.
