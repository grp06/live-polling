What changed, why:
- Added admin utils Jest tests to drive the refactor.
- Ran the focused test to establish the failing baseline (missing module).
- Updated ExecPlan progress and CURRENT.md to reflect the failing test state.

What was observed:
- Jest fails with "Cannot find module '../_utils'" in app/api/admin/__tests__/adminUtils.test.ts.

Commits:
- None.
