## What changed, why
- Authored a new execplan at `.agent/execplan-pending.md` to consolidate repeated error banners into a shared `ErrorBanner` component.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to reflect the new pending plan and next actions.

## What was observed
- The same error banner markup appears in `app/page.tsx`, `app/results/page.tsx`, and `app/admin/AdminClient.tsx`.

## Commits
- None.
