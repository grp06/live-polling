# Journal Entry (2026-01-13 14:25:36)

What changed, why:
- Trimmed excessive vertical spacing on the /results page by removing min-h-screen sections and reducing vertical padding/gaps so the header, active poll card, and results fit on one screen.

What was observed:
- Large empty vertical gaps on /results made the content appear far apart.

Links to commits:
- None.
