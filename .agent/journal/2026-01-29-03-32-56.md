What changed, why:
- Ran manual smoke checks against the dev server to confirm 401/400 responses for admin endpoints.
- Updated ExecPlan progress and outcomes to reflect the manual validation.
- Updated CURRENT.md to reflect completion status.

What was observed:
- `/api/admin/presets?key=bad` returned 401.
- `/api/admin/clear` with invalid JSON returned 400.
- `/api/admin/open` with bad key returned 401.
