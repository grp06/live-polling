# Journal Entry (2026-01-12-17-22-50)

## What changed, why
- Lazily initialize the KV client to avoid build-time env checks and allow Next.js to build without evaluating KV during prerender.
- Split the admin page into a server wrapper with Suspense and a client component to satisfy the Next.js requirement for `useSearchParams`.

## What was observed
- `npm run build` now completes successfully after the admin Suspense change.
- Prior build failure: missing suspense for `useSearchParams` and KV env check during build.

## Links to commits
- No commits yet.
