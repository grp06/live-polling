# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:09:52)

What changed, why:
- Added `lib/apiClient.ts` and refactored client fetch call sites in `app/page.tsx`, `app/admin/AdminClient.tsx`, and `lib/hooks/usePollState.ts` to centralize JSON/error handling.
- Updated the execplan progress/outcomes and moved it to `.agent/done` after completion.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passes; console.error output in admin utils tests is expected.
