# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 20:55:19)

What changed, why:
- Replaced `.agent/execplans/execplan.md` with a new consolidation plan focused on admin route authorization/parsing to reduce duplicated auth logic while keeping existing endpoints intact.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to point to the new execplan and reflect next actions for test-first implementation.

What was observed:
- Admin API routes repeat the same authorization/parsing steps across `open`, `close`, `clear`, and `presets`, making auth changes require edits in four files.

Links to commits:
- None.
