What changed, why:
- Replaced the prior ExecPlan with a new consolidation refactor plan focused on admin API auth and JSON parsing, per the current request.
- Saved the plan to `.agent/execplans/execplan.md`, `.agent/EXECPLAN.md`, and `.agent/execplan-pending.md` to satisfy repo and skill requirements.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to reflect the new plan and next actions.

What was observed:
- Admin auth and `ADMIN_KEY` checks are duplicated across open/close/presets routes; clear lacks missing-key and JSON parse guards.

Commits:
- None.
