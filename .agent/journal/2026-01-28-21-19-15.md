# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:19:15)

What changed, why:
- Added `lib/pollValidation.ts` to centralize poll type/options validation.
- Refactored `lib/pollService.ts` and `lib/prewrittenPolls.ts` to use the shared validation helpers.
- Added Jest coverage in `lib/__tests__/pollValidation.test.ts` and completed the execplan.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passes; console.error output in admin utils tests is expected.

Links to commits:
- None.
