## What changed, why
- Drafted a new ExecPlan to consolidate API route helpers into a shared `app/api/_utils.ts`, remove duplicated JSON parsing and 500-response handling, and update routes/tests accordingly.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to point at the new ExecPlan and outline next steps.

## What was observed
- Admin API routes share `app/api/admin/_utils.ts`, while `app/api/vote/route.ts` re-implements JSON parsing and multiple routes duplicate identical 500-error handling.

## Commits
- None.
