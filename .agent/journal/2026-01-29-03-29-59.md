What changed, why:
- Added `app/api/admin/_utils.ts` to centralize admin key resolution, authorization, and JSON parsing.
- Refactored admin routes to use the helper for consistent auth/JSON handling.
- Added Jest tests for the helper and ran the full suite to validate behavior.

What was observed:
- Jest passes; the missing-ADMIN_KEY test triggers the expected console.error.

Commits:
- None.
