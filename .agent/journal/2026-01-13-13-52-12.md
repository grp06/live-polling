What changed, why:
- Added Jest tests for prewritten poll parsing in `lib/__tests__/prewrittenPolls.test.ts` to drive the new presets feature via TDD.

What was observed:
- `npm test` failed as expected because `lib/prewrittenPolls.ts` does not exist yet (module not found).

Links to commits:
- None yet.
