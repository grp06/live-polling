What changed, why:
- Added a projector-only `/results` route that shows the active poll, live results, and history without voting controls.
- Adjusted attendee layout to use full-width cards on desktop and removed the multiple-choice hint text.
- Updated multiple-choice results to keep bar widths consistent even with long labels.
- Documented the new `/results` route in `README.md`.

What was observed:
- Tests not run (UI/layout changes).

Links to commits:
- None yet.
