## What changed, why
- Consolidated API route helpers into `app/api/_utils.ts`, updated all API routes and tests to use it, and removed the admin-only helper file.
- Ran Jest and manual API smoke checks to ensure error payloads and status codes remain consistent.
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reference the new shared helper location.

## What was observed
- `npm test` passed with expected console.error output from auth/error helper tests.
- Manual API checks (via dev server on port 3002) returned expected 400/401 responses for invalid JSON, missing anonId, and unauthorized admin key.
