What changed, why:
- Added `scripts/test-agg.mjs` and `test:agg` script to follow TDD for aggregation logic.
- Ran the aggregation test to establish a failing baseline before implementation.

What was observed:
- `npm run test:agg` failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for `lib/pollService.ts` (expected before implementation).

Links to commits:
- None.
