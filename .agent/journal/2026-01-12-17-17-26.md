# Journal Entry (2026-01-12-17-17-26)

## What changed, why
- Updated `kvHGetAll` to normalize array responses into an object, preventing field names from being treated as vote values.
- Added unit tests for `kvHGetAll` covering array and object responses.

## What was observed
- Error stack: invalid vote value from `parseVote` when `Object.values` included the hash field name.
- `npm test` passes (4 tests).

## Links to commits
- No commits yet.
