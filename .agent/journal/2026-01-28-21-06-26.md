# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:06:26)

What changed, why:
- Authored a new ExecPlan to consolidate client-side fetch/JSON error handling and saved it to `.agent/execplan-pending.md` and `.agent/execplans/execplan.md` for execution.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to point to the new pending plan and outline next steps.

What was observed:
- No tests run; this is a planning-only update.

Links to commits:
- None.
