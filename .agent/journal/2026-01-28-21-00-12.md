# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:00:12)

What changed, why:
- Added `app/api/admin/adminRoute.ts` to centralize admin-key authorization and parsing for JSON and query requests.
- Refactored admin routes (`open`, `close`, `clear`, `presets`) to use the shared helper while preserving existing error responses.
- Added Jest coverage for the new helper and moved the completed execplan to `.agent/done`.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passes; console.error output remains in admin utils tests (expected behavior).
