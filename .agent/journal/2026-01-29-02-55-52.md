# Journal Entry

Date: 2026-01-29

## What changed, why
- Backed up the prior execplan to a timestamped file to preserve history before drafting a new refactor plan.
- Authored a new execplan for consolidating poll-state fetching/polling into a shared hook, per the refactor-something request.
- Synced the plan to `.agent/EXECPLAN.md` to satisfy execplan-authoring output requirements.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to reflect the new active execplan and next steps.

## What was observed
- Poll-state fetch and error handling logic is duplicated across `app/page.tsx`, `app/results/page.tsx`, and `app/admin/AdminClient.tsx`.
- No tests were run during planning.

## Links to commits
- None (planning changes only).
