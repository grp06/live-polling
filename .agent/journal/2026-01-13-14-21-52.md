What changed, why:
- Enlarged live results typography and bars (especially for projector/large mode) and normalized multiple-choice bar widths.
- Updated /results layout so the header, active poll, and live results each fill a full viewport height, pushing history below the fold.

What was observed:
- Tests not run (layout/typography changes).

Links to commits:
- None yet.
