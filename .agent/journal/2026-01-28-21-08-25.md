# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:08:25)

What changed, why:
- Added failing Jest coverage for the planned client fetch helper in `lib/__tests__/apiClient.test.ts`.

What was observed:
- `npm test` fails because `@/lib/apiClient` is not yet implemented (expected at this stage).

Links to commits:
- None.
