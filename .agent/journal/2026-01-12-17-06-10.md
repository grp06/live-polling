# Journal Entry (2026-01-12-17-06-10)

## What changed, why
- Switched KV client initialization to use `createClient` with `automaticDeserialization: false` to stop `@vercel/kv` from auto-parsing JSON values that `kvGetJson` expects as strings.
- Added explicit env var check in `lib/kv.ts` to fail fast with the same missing-env error message used by `@vercel/kv`.

## What was observed
- Runtime error when reading active poll: `Expected string value for key poll:active` from `kvGetJson`.

## Links to commits
