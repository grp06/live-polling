What changed, why:
- Added a ResultsPage polling test (jsdom) to ensure projector mode keeps polling with no active poll.

- Updated results page polling effect to run regardless of active poll state.

What was observed:
- npm test -- --runTestsByPath app/__tests__/resultsPolling.test.ts

Commits:
- None.
