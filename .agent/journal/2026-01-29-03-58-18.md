What changed, why:
- Authored a consolidation refactor recommendation and created `.agent/execplan-pending.md` to centralize duplicated page shell/backdrop markup.
- Synced the plan into `.agent/execplans/execplan.md` and initialized `.agent/CURRENT.md` for tracking.

What was observed:
- The attendee and results pages share identical backdrop markup in `app/page.tsx` and `app/results/page.tsx`.
- The admin page repeats similar backdrop markup in `app/admin/AdminClient.tsx` (two variants).

Commits:
- None (plan only).
