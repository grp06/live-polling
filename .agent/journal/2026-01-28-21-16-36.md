# Journal Entry (2026-01-28 21:16:36)

What changed, why:
- Drafted a new ExecPlan to consolidate poll type/options validation into `lib/pollValidation.ts` and saved it to `.agent/execplan-pending.md` plus `.agent/execplans/execplan.md`.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to reflect the new pending plan and next actions.

What was observed:
- No tests run; this is a planning-only update.

Links to commits:
- None.
