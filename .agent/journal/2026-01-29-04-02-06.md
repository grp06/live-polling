What changed, why:
- Added `components/PageShell.tsx` to centralize shared page shell/backdrop markup.
- Updated `app/page.tsx`, `app/results/page.tsx`, and `app/admin/AdminClient.tsx` to use `PageShell` variants.
- Updated execplan progress tracking and re-ran tests.

What was observed:
- `npm test` passes (console.error logged by `requireAdminKey` test as expected).

Commits:
- None.
