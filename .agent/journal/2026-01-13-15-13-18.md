# Journal Entry (2026-01-13 15:13:18)

What changed, why:
- Restored attendee polling at 1s intervals only when no active poll is present, so clients can detect when a new poll starts without polling during active voting.

What was observed:
- Needed a lightweight discovery loop for new polls while keeping KV reads low during active polls.

Links to commits:
- None.
