# Journal Entry - 2026-01-28 20:18:30

## What changed, why
- Archived the previous pending PageShell execplan into `.agent/execplans/execplan-pageshell-2026-01-28-20-17-04.md` to avoid overwriting it.
- Authored a new execplan at `.agent/execplan-pending.md` to consolidate API route helpers.
- Updated `.agent/CURRENT.md` to reflect the new pending execplan and next actions.

## What was observed
- API routes duplicate error handling and JSON parsing across multiple files, while admin routes share a local helper.

## Commits
- None.
