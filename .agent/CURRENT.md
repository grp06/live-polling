Last known failing tests summary: npm test -- --runTestsByPath app/__tests__/resultsPolling.test.ts (pass)
Next actions:
1) Share summary with the user and ask for results page verification.
2) Optionally run full npm test suite if you want broader coverage.
3) If projector still sticks, consider shortening the polling interval.
Temporary constraints: keep KV interactions mocked in tests; avoid destructive actions.
