Active execplan path: .agent/execplans/execplan.md
Last known failing tests summary: not run in this planning session (last known: npm test -- --runTestsByPath app/__tests__/resultsPolling.test.ts passed)
Next actions:
1) Review the proposed consolidation refactor and approve or adjust scope.
2) Implement the shared poll-state hook and refactor the three client pages.
3) Add/update Jest tests, then run npm test.
Temporary constraints: keep KV interactions mocked in tests; avoid destructive actions.
