# Current State

Active execplan path: .agent/execplan-pending.md

Last known failing tests summary:
- `npm test` passes (note: expected console.error from `requireAdminKey` test).

Next 1-3 concrete actions:
1) Manually verify attendee, results, and admin pages render unchanged (per execplan acceptance).
2) Move the completed execplan to `.agent/done` after manual verification.

Temporary constraints:
- None noted.
